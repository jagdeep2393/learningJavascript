    <title>Where To Put Javascript</title>
    <!-- We can add Javascript in head tag like below. -->
    <!-- <script src="app.js" defer></script> -->
</head>
<body>
      <p>
        <h3><b>Where to Put the Script in my Page</b></h3>
        <strong>In this Project I m going mostly use Inline Javascript.</strong>
        We have two options to put the Javascript code in our webpage inside <head>  and inside <body>.Generally <head> tag includes the script that are essential for page inititlization or contain configuration related scripts.These Scripts loaded before the DOM parsing got completed which means they may block the page rendering if they contains the long running tasks or they depends on DOM content loading.<br/>
        Script that are Generally included in body script tag are mostly non-critical ones. Script that need to be executed for page interactivity after loading of web page are mostly embeded inside the body.They does'nt block the page rendering.
        </p>
    
      <p>
         <h3><b>defer</b></h3>
          Defer Rending rely on DOM and will execute only when DOM get fully loaded and Parsed.But it download the script and it depedencies asynchronously parallel to HTML Content and pervent page from blocking.It waits for the DOMContentLoaded Event to fire before starts execution.When Page have multiple defer scripts then they runs in order in placed inside code. 
      </p>      
      <p>
        <h3><b>async</b></h3>
        An other end asyn is also used to load Javascript asynchronously but it download the script parallel with the html content and run imidiatly independently. It does'nt rely on DOM Content and works differenly if not handled properly.It is mainly suitable for script that works independently.If multiple async script are there they execute out of order.
      </p>

    <p>
        <h3><b>crossorigin</b></h3>
        Script tag also have crossorigin attribute,In normal Script tag if a script fails CORS Check then it send minimal information to window.onerror event but if we use crossorigin then it will send the full loggin information regarding the CORS check.
    </p>   
    <p>
        <h3><b>importmap</b></h3>
        Script tag also have importmap attribute which used to import modules from differnt resources using a json module mapping.
        <pre>
            <!-- <script type="importmap"> -->
                {
                    "imports":{
                        "jsAlert":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-alert@2.0.0/+esm"
                    }
                }
                import * as alertBox from "jsAlert";
                console.log(alertBox);
            <!-- </script> -->
        </pre>
        </p>
    <!-- We Can also add Javascript here using <script></script> -->
    <script src="app.js" defer></script>
    <script type="importmap">
        {
          "imports": {
            "lodash": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.21/lodash.min.js"
            <!-- "axios": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@0.21.1/dist/axios.min.js" -->
          }
        }
      </script>
    
      <!-- Load a module using the importmap -->
      <script type="module">
        // Import modules using the mapped specifiers
        import { debounce } from 'lodash';
        // import axios from 'axios';
    
        // Use the imported modules
        console.log(debounce); // lodash debounce function
        // console.log(axios);    // Axios library
      </script>
